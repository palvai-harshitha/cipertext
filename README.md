Python code for which we can create own logic for encryption and decryption of messages so that interpreter cannot find the actual data to modify it
logic here which I have used is my own logic though python has package called cryptography which also geterates keys. If we want to encrypt the word "HELLO" then the first letter will be same the second letter will be replaced by "F" i.e, E+1...third letter will be replace by "O" i,e L+2...fourth will be replaced by "O" i.e, L+3. it increments till the value is equal to length of word
In this code there is logic for both encrypt and decrypt of the message.
